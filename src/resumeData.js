    "aboutme":"I’m a full stack developer and a former Wildlife Biologist. I recently wrapped up an intensive course study at Flatiron School and am excited to combine my knowledge of scientific data collection with my experience in Python and Javascript.  I’m working on developing an application to allow data collected in the field to be accessed instantaneously, if not soon after it is collected.  It has been really great combining my passion for problem solving, computer programming, and wildlife research.  I am hoping to continue to improve on user obtained data collection in my future projects.",
